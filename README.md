# VoiceGaurdAI
An AI-powered voice detection system designed to identify and analyze audio signals to determine whether a voice is real (human) or AI-generated. This project helps in preventing voice fraud, deepfake attacks, and identity misuse by using machine learning techniques to analyze voice patterns, frequency features, and speech characteristics.
